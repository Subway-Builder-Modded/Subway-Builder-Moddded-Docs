## Common Issues

:::info

Before reading through this section, please ensure you are on the latest version of the
[Map Manager](https://github.com/Subway-Builder-Modded/subwaybuilder-patcher/releases).

:::

### I'm trying to select the metro-maker4 folder, but the Map Manager is telling me that I'm selecting the wrong folder. What gives?

It's possible you are selecting the right folder if you are on an old version, which had a bug where
the directory check would fail if a certain folder did not exist due to saves not being created.
This can be resolved by updating your game. This has since been fixed. If you are still encountering
this issue, it is likely you are unintentionally trying to select the wrong folder. The common
locations for the metro-maker4 folder can be found in the popup window shown by the Map Manager.

### MacOS is telling me the installer is broken/corrupted, and that I should delete it.

This is because as an Open Source project, we do not have the resources to pay for a MacOS developer
license, and you must dequarantine the file or Allow Apps From Anywhere in MacOS settings. To
dequarantine the file, use the command
`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine path/to/Subway.Builder.Map.Manager-vX.Y.Z.dmg`, then run the
installer again. Note that that isn't the actual command! You'll need to replace the path to the
installer yourself.

### What the hell?! My game keeps freezing every few minutes!

This issue has been confirmed to exist outside of modded maps, and is outside of our expertise. You
can join the [Subway Builder Discord Server](https://discord.gg/GS5yhuatWb) for support, but we are
unable to guarantee you will get an immediate solution.

### My map failed to install, or the Map Manager seems to be taking an infinitely long time to import my map.

This is likely an issue with the structure of the map bundle. All files must be in the root of the
zip file and CANNOT be in a subdirectory, and the config must be valid JSON. Ensure you're on the
latest version of the Map Manager, then contact the creator of the map if installation fails again.

### I installed a map and launched the game from the Map Manager, but my maps aren't there!

You must enable the mod the first time you add a map in order for the game to actually load them. To
do this, go into Settings, Mod Settings, and enable the Map Loader mod, then reload mods. Your maps
should be there!

### I started the game and tried to play a modded map, but the map loads forever, or loads without colors and buildings!

Because of the nature of how the game works, you must launch your game from the Map Manager in order
for modded maps to have buildings and water/parks appear.

### My game crashed! What happened?

Please send a copy of your save, along with the latest log file (located in the logs subdirectory of
your save folder, which can be opened from the settings menu), to #Mod Support in the
[Subway Builder Discord Server](https://discord.gg/GS5yhuatWb).

### I'm getting a JavaScript Error Pop-up!

Update your game to the latest
[release](https://github.com/Subway-Builder-Modded/subwaybuilder-patcher/releases), then try to do
whatever you did again.

### The Map Manager says I've already installed a mod for this city but I haven't. What is going on here?

Unfortunately, some mods (such as Toronto and Torino) are known to have conflicting city codes,
which is how the game manages map registration. Please contact the creator of either (or both) of
these maps to resolve this situation.

### I have some other problem not listed here! What do I do?

Join the [Subway Builder Discord Server](https://discord.gg/GS5yhuatWb), and ask your question in
\#Mod Support. A member of the community will be able to help you!
