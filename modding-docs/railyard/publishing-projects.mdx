Railyard does not host mods or maps within the service. Instead, Railyard pulls from its [registry](https://github.com/Subway-Builder-Modded/The-Railyard), which contains the data pointing to all the user-created projects. To add a project to Railyard for people to download and play with, you must first add it to the registry.

:::important

If you have many different maps, you can upload them all onto one repository instead of creating one for each individual map using [this guide](/modding-docs/railyard/publishing-map-packs) instead. This can be helpful if you are the creator of a map pack (like the [France Pack](https://github.com/flopinou/FrancePack)), which often contain large numbers of maps.

:::

## Step 1 - Hosting the File {#hosting-the-file}
In order to make a submission to the Railyard registry, you need to first upload the source code and release to GitHub and link it to Railyard. To do this, create a new GitHub repository. The actual contents can contain the source code for your map/mod.

:::note

Railyard is currently looking to implement a system to check mods for direct dependencies to other mods.

There currently exists an optional field in the mod's `manifest.json` to store dependencies, e.g.:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "mod_id_1": ">=0.3.0"
  "mod_id_2": ">=0.5.5"
},
"version": "x.y.z"
```

However, there is no clear documentation on the intended structure.

If you have feedback on a preferred structure/format for dependency tracking, please tag one of the Railyard members in #modders of the Subway Builder Discord.

:::

Once you have the repository set up, create a new release. In this release, place **ALL** the ZIP files containing your maps (as different release assets). They should contain **exactly** files that are used for the map, meaning no nested subfolders. For maps, use the ZIP that you made using the [custom map creation guide](/modding-docs/creating-maps/making-custom-maps).

## Step 2 - Submitting to the Registry {#submitting-to-the-registry}
Now that your files are hosted on GitHub, you are ready to make a submission to the registry. Go to the [registry's issues page](https://github.com/Subway-Builder-Modded/The-Railyard/issues) and click on "`New Issue`". Here, you can create your submission, which will then be reviewed by a Railyard maintainer. Once you have the issue selection screen open, select "`Publish New Map`" or "`Publish New Mod`", depending on the type of the project you are trying to submit. The next process will differ a little depending on if you are submitting a map or a mod.

Once you select "`Publish New Map`", a popup window will appear to input some information about the map. The information should be inputted as follows:

```
Map ID:       A unique identifier for your map in kebab-case. This is the permanent directory name in the
              registry and cannot be changed later. Must be unique across all maps, so if another map of the
              same city already exists, use a distinct ID (e.g. london-detailed, london-mini). Only lowercase
              letters, numbers, and hyphens allowed.

City Name:    The human-readable city name shown in Railyard. This is the title of the map that people will see when
              downloading it.

City Code:    2-4 letter IATA/ICAO-style city code used by the game internally. Must be uppercase letters/numbers.
              Must not clash with vanilla city codes or other registered maps. Check existing maps before choosing
              a code.

Country Code: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code — two uppercase letters (e.g. US, GB, CA, DE, JP). Used to group maps
              by country in Railyard. It is REQUIRED that you use ISO codes according to this list:
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes.

Population:   Approximate metropolitan area population. Number only, no commas or separators. Used for display and
              sorting in Railyard and it doesn't need to be exact.

Description:  A short description of what your map does. This is shown in the map browser. Mention data quality,
              notable features, or coverage area.

Tags:         Select all tags that apply to your map. These help users find your map in the browser.

Data Source:  Enter the data source used to generate the demand data for your map. The source name
              should use common abbreviations like LODES/INSEE/ONS etc. (optional, defaults to OSM)

Source URL:   URL to your map's source code repository or download page.

Update Type:  The method used by Railyard to fetch updates for your map. Most maps should use GitHub Releases. Use
              Custom URL only if you host your own update.json file.

GitHub Repo:  Required ONLY if using GitHub Releases. The owner/repo path (e.g. username/sb-raleigh) in plaintext, NOT a URL. The repo must
              exist, have at least one release, and the latest release must contain a .zip asset. Leave blank if you
              are using Custom URL.

Custom URL:   Required ONLY if you selected Custom URL. The full URL to your self-hosted update.json file. The file
              must follow the Railyard update.json schema. Leave blank if using GitHub Releases. The update.json can be
              found at: https://subwaybuildermodded.com/modding-docs/railyard/publishing-map-packs#custom-update-schema-template.

Gallery:      Drag and drop screenshots here, or paste image URLs (one per line). These will be displayed in the map
              browser. At least one image is recommended. (optional)
```

Once you do that, a Pull Request should automatically be created. A Railyard maintainer will review it and it will be automatically submitted once they do. After that, it will be available on Railyard for everyone to download.

<TabItem value="submitting-mods" label="Submitting Mods">

Once you select "`Publish New Mod`", a popup window will appear asking us to input some information about our mod. The information should be inputted as follows:

```
Mod ID:       A unique identifier for your mod in kebab-case. This is the permanent directory name in the registry
              and cannot be changed later. Must be unique across all mods, so check existing listings before
              submitting. Only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens allowed.

Display Name: The human-readable mod name shown in Railyard. This is the title of the mod that people will see when
              downloading it.

Description:  A short description of what your mod does. This is shown in the mod browser.

Tags:         Select all tags that apply to your mod. These help users find your mod in the browser.

Source URL:   URL to your mod's source code repository or download page.

Update Type:  The method used by Railyard to fetch updates for your mod. Most mods should use GitHub Releases. Use
              Custom URL only if you host your own update.json file.

GitHub Repo:  Required ONLY if using GitHub Releases. The owner/repo path (e.g. username/better-trains). The repo must
              exist, have at least one release, and the latest release must contain a .zip asset. Leave blank if you
              are using Custom URL.

Custom URL:   Required if using Custom URL. The full URL to your self-hosted update.json file. The file must follow
              the Railyard update.json schema. Leave blank if using GitHub Releases. The update.json can be found at:
              https://subwaybuildermodded.com/modding-docs/railyard/publishing-map-packs#custom-update-schema-template.

Gallery:      Drag and drop screenshots here, or paste image URLs (one per line). These will be displayed in the mod
              browser. At least one image is recommended. (optional)
```

Once you fill out the submission ticket, a Pull Request should automatically be created. A Railyard maintainer will review it and it will be automatically submitted once they do. After that, it will be available on Railyard for everyone to download.
