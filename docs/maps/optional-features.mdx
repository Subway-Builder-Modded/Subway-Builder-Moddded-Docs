title: Optional Features
---

This guide covers optional features for [Kronifer's Map Manager](https://github.com/Kronifer/subwaybuilder-patcher/releases) that can be added by map makers. These optional features are mostly visual/UI-related and have no effect on gameplay.

## Thumbnail {#thumbnail}

The thumbnail of a map is the image that is displayed when a player tries to make a new map.

<img width="300" alt="image" src="/images/create-thumbnail.png" />

We can create a custom one 2 different ways.

:::tip
The thumbnail is optional, however if you do not set it, it will appear blank.
<img width="150" alt="image" src="/images/empty-thumbnail.png" />
:::

### Method 1 - Config File {#config-file}

To create a custom thumbnail using the `config.json` file, you can simply add the following field into the file:
```json
  "thumbnailBbox": [minLon /*West*/, minLat /*South*/, maxLon /*East*/, maxLat /*North*/]
```

This will automatically generate a vanilla-styled thumbnail for your map based on the bounding box you inputted.

### Method 2 - Custom Image {#custom-image}

To create a custom thumbnail using an image, you can add a `XXX.svg` (`XXX` is your city code). Simply place it with the other data files within the ZIP and the Map Manager will automatically use it as the thumbnail for your map. The image must be in SVG format.

## Custom Country Tab {#custom-country-tab}

When you import your maps, they will appear under the "`Custom`" tab in the map creation screen. We can create a custom tab if we have a map for a different country. This will allow us to set it to appear under that country's tab, as do vanilla maps.

<img width="500" alt="image" src="/images/map-country-tabs.png" />

:::important
This currently will not work for United States or United Kingdom maps, as those countries are already categorized under the "`US`" and "`UK`" tabs respectively and are handled differently internally.
:::

To do this, you can simply add the following field into your `config.json` file:
```json
  "country": "en" /* The country code of the country you want your map to be categorized under. For example, "en" for England, "fr" for France, etc. A list of country codes can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes. */
```

This will automatically categorize your map under the specified country's tab. If you do not include this field, your map will be categorized under the "`Custom`" tab by default.

:::note
All custom maps will still be categorized under the "`Custom`" tab in the map creation screen, regardless of whether or not you have this field in your `config.json`. This only adds it to that country's tab in addition to the "`Custom`" tab.
